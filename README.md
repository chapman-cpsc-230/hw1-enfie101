## Description

_\<This assignment involved problems for which code was to be written, as well as finding problems with given code and fixing it, so it would generate the correct output.\>_

## What I Learned from This

_\<I learned how to write code that generates output which is easily readable in English.  I used an 'if' statement and defined variables used later in the code.  I learned that you have to be very careful in the way you write your code because even the slightest mistake could make it not work.\>_

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

Signed,
